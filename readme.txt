Development log:
Started on May 11

made the painting and GUI portions by may 12
started the multicast on may 12
multicast was not sending or sending or receiving

decided to use a different method to add clients to group
restarted multicast may 13
creating packets
host is creator of image
client is someone who joins
client needs to catch up to host and rest of group when joining

May 14 redoing how to catch up in a way that hopefully works
